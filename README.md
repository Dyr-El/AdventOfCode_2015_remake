# AdventOfCode_2015_remake
A remake of solutions for AdventOfCode 2015.

This is my attempt to make a bit clearer and cleaner python solution in Jupyter Notebooks.
I redid my solutions for 2015 to practice a bit for this year and try out this modus operandi.

Observe that there is no limitations on how many times the input file (`content`) can be loaded from the server, but refrain from reloading that part too often not
to stress the servers.

Also observe that there is some feeble attempts to handle a authenticating proxy server, since I sometime reside behind such a contraprtion and have some idea on just
how annoying they can be. This is even more untested than the rest of the code so use it with gentle care.
